# Shopping Predictor

This project aims to develop a machine learning model based on the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to predict whether online shopping customers will complete a purchase based on various features related to their browsing behavior and other relevant information. The dataset used for this project, shopping.csv, contains approximately 12,000 user sessions with multiple features such as page visits, duration, Google Analytics metrics, special day proximity, month, operating system, browser, region, traffic type, visitor type, and weekend visits. The target variable, Revenue, indicates whether the user ultimately made a purchase (TRUE) or not (FALSE).
